# Movie Search

![Movie Search Screenshot](/src/movie-search-snapshot.jpg "Movie Search Screenshot")

In this Movie Search project the user can enter in any movie title and it will search through the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API to get the information for the movie(s). It should display the movie poster and the date it was released when the user hovers over the movie poster. If the movie does not have a movie poster it will display a placeholder instead, but if the title does not exist in the database it will not show any results. This Movie Search was made using React.
